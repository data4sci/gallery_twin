text_md: 'A figure in vibrant, cartoon-like colors twists into a compact, surreal
  pose, its exaggerated features merging with playful shapes. Crimson boots, a plumed
  hat, and an eye peering from splayed fingers add theatrical whimsy against a bold
  yellow backdrop.


  ## Content


  The artwork shows a surreal human figure contorted into a crouch, dressed in a red-plumed
  hat with a black brim, a feather, a red boot and blue pants. Its cartoonish face
  has one large sideways eye while another lies on the ground under a stylized, oversized
  hand splayed beside it. Dark hair trails through a castle-like arch. The striped
  cloth in red, white and green suggests festivity. The posture is defensive, arms
  and knees drawn in, partially concealing the face.


  ## Elements Arrangement


  Foreground: the red boot, hand and ground-level eye. Middle ground: the main figure
  with its striped garment and exaggerated limbs. Left: a white, castle-like arch
  framing the hair. Background: a flat yellow field with no depth. A floating blue
  orb and red feather add surreal balance. The horizon is implied, and space is flattened
  and non-naturalistic.


  ## Notable Details


  - The eye on the ground hints at perception or vigilance.

  - The castle arch suggests entrapment, contrasting the organic hair.

  - Bold, cartoonish color blocks and smooth forms create a toy-like whimsy.

  - The costume evokes historical or theatrical dress and performative flair.

  - Textures vary: glossy hat, soft hair, plush boot.


  ## Overall Composition


  A tightly composed, near-geometric figure fills the square canvas. Vibrant reds
  intersect quieter blues and yellows to balance visual weight. The eye moves in a
  circle: boot to body curve, feathery hat, blue orb, then hand and eye. A tilted
  head and angled body are stabilized by the left arch, guiding attention across multiple
  surreal focal points.


  ## Artistic Style


  The piece blends Contemporary Surrealism, Pop Art and Cubism. Exaggerated, overlapping
  forms mix human features with abstract shapes. Bold outlines, flattened perspectives
  and playful, graphic rendering nod to Pop Art, while surreal imagery and fragmented
  elements recall Surrealist tradition in a modern graphic approach.


  ## Technique


  Appears to be oil on canvas, with smooth blending, slight gloss and controlled brushwork.
  Precise lines define shapes and subtle shading outlines form. Impasto appears minimally
  on the red feather and highlights, but most surfaces are sleek. Clean edges and
  solid color blocks emphasize graphic clarity over textured surface.


  ## Color Palette


  Bold, primary colors—bright yellow, deep blue, vivid red, grassy green—dominate,
  with accents of black, brown and neutrals. High chroma, flat application and strong
  contrasts give an energetic, playful feel. Stylized shadows and highlights suggest
  depth without sacrificing flat graphic unity, heightening the surreal intensity.

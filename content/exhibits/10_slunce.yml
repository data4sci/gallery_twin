text_md: 'A contorted blue figure arches around a radiant yellow orb, hand atop its
  glowing spikes. This bold, surreal fusion of human form and vivid geometry evokes
  tension and wonder.


  ## Content


  The artwork shows a stylized human figure bent backward in a near-circular pose.
  Its left arm arcs from bottom left to center, hand resting on a radiant, spiked
  yellow orb. The face, at the lower center, looks up with a wide, intense eye and
  introspective expression. The legs, clad in blue with decorative buttons, extend
  to the right, feet pointing downward and right. The pink, five-fingered hand on
  the orb emphasizes its grip. The scene conveys surreal convolution and introspection,
  suggesting a symbolic link between figure, sun, and pose.


  ## Elements Arrangement


  The yellow sun/orb sits at the intersection of the figure''s arms and legs, acting
  as the visual and conceptual anchor. The figure loops around the orb, enclosing
  the pictorial space. Foreground elements are limited to the limbs and orb; the flat
  composition lacks a distinct background. A peach ground offers an uninterrupted
  backdrop, highlighting the self-contained space formed by the figure''s body. Depth
  is compressed into a contiguous, two-dimensional layout.


  ## Notable Details


  Sharp orange spikes radiate from the orb, intersecting limbs to add tension and
  movement. The face is framed by exaggerated, swirling hair and a cool-blue eye that
  contrasts warm yellows. Buttons and patterned cuffs on the pants add whimsical costume
  details. A subtle, eye-like design at the orb''s center reinforces themes of vision
  and insight. Gentle gradients and painterly transitions enrich the textures of clothing
  and skin.


  ## Overall Composition


  The tightly coiled figure and central orb form the compositional heart. A spiral
  of the body and radiating sun lines guide the viewer''s gaze around and back to
  the center. Symmetry balances each side of the figure encircling the orb. The square
  format amplifies the sense of enclosure and focus, underscoring the introspective,
  contained nature. The absence of extraneous detail spotlights the surreal interaction
  between figure and radiant orb, yielding a visually compelling, enigmatic scene.


  ## Artistic Style


  The work aligns with Surrealism, featuring dreamlike distortion of human forms and
  unexpected juxtapositions. Exaggerated anatomy and the fusion of figure and sun
  imagery evoke a psychological narrative. Playful, simplified shapes and bold outlines
  recall modernist illustration and Neo-Expressionism, prioritizing emotion over realism.
  A contemporary eclecticism blends classic Surrealism with figurative abstraction.


  ## Technique


  Executed in oil or acrylic on canvas, it features smooth, even gradients and soft
  blending, especially in skin and sun. Brushwork is controlled and tight, lending
  a polished, graphic quality. Defined, flowing contours articulate the figure and
  rays, while tonal transitions reflect careful layering. The matte, unified surface
  shows no mixed media or collage.


  ## Color Palette


  A complementary contrast of cool blues (figure and clothing) and warm yellows and
  oranges (sun) defines the palette. Cool and warm zones divide clearly, with blues
  from deep navy to pastel, and highly saturated, luminous yellows and oranges. Moderate
  tonal range and high contrast emphasize the central sun form. Bold, pure hues create
  a surreal, theatrical mood.

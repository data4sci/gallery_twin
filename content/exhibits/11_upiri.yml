title: "Upíří kousnutí"
text_md: |
  Bold, looping forms and vivid colors intertwine to form a fragmented abstract figure. Layered shapes suggest human features entwined with decorative patterns, merging playful geometry with mystery and emotional tension.

  ## Content

  The painting depicts two abstract, intertwining figures locked in an embrace. The left figure has light, curly hair and a blue eye peeking through arms; the right has long brown hair and an intense red eye. One gaze seems contemplative or sad, the other direct and penetrating. Together they evoke intimacy, guardianship, or internal duality.

  ## Elements Arrangement

  Entangled figures fill the center, extending toward the foreground and edges. A flat blue area beneath hints at support without defining space. To the left, a stylized wooden chair or architectural form rises vertically, adding structure. Bright, ribbon-like elements wrap the forms like clothing or symbolic mantles. Without a horizon line, the compressed space focuses on the central shapes.

  ## Notable Details

  Notable details include stacked, donut-shaped yellow forms between the bodies, possibly symbolic or whimsical. Bold stripes (red, yellow, white, blue, green) on fabric-like shapes add decorative or ceremonial references. Textural brushwork gives the hair and garments movement. The stylized chair suggests ritual, while the saturated palette intensifies the emotional impact. Small red dots on the lower left hint at further symbolism.

  ## Overall Composition

  A tight, nearly square format contains interlocked curving forms, creating tension and containment. Rhythmic contours guide the eye around the bodies and colored bands, with the red eye at top center as the main focal point. The vertical chair contrasts horizontal curves, adding energy and grounding the scene. Arcing color bands and the blue base frame the image, lending a meditative, iconic quality.

  ## Artistic Style

  Modernist abstraction with Cubist deconstruction and Pop Art flair: flat picture plane, geometric interlocking curvilinear shapes. Bulging segments recall Cubism; bold outlines and smooth, cartoon-like surfaces evoke Pop Art. Ornamental details also hint at indigenous and folk motifs.

  ## Technique

  Likely oil or acrylic on canvas, with smooth, controlled brushwork and glossy, plastic-like surfaces. Clean curved edges and volumetric modeling—especially in hair and donut forms—contrast with minimal expressive marks. The polished, uniform finish blurs foreground and background for a consistent stylized effect.

  ## Color Palette

  A vivid palette of primary (red, yellow, blue) and saturated secondary (green, brown, ochre) hues. High-contrast, bright colors energize the image, pairing warm and cool tones for impact. Stylized light and shadow emphasize form over realism, creating a playful, dynamic, surreal mood in a modernist vein.

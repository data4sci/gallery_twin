title: "Házení okem"
text_md: |
  A figure in vibrant, cartoon-like colors twists into a compact, surreal pose, its exaggerated features merging with playful shapes. Crimson boots, a plumed hat, and an eye peering from splayed fingers add theatrical whimsy against a bold yellow backdrop.

  ## Content

  The artwork shows a surreal human figure contorted into a crouch, dressed in a red-plumed hat with a black brim, a feather, a red boot and blue pants. Its cartoonish face has one large sideways eye while another lies on the ground under a stylized, oversized hand splayed beside it. Dark hair trails through a castle-like arch. The striped cloth in red, white and green suggests festivity. The posture is defensive, arms and knees drawn in, partially concealing the face.

  ## Elements Arrangement

  Foreground: the red boot, hand and ground-level eye. Middle ground: the main figure with its striped garment and exaggerated limbs. Left: a white, castle-like arch framing the hair. Background: a flat yellow field with no depth. A floating blue orb and red feather add surreal balance. The horizon is implied, and space is flattened and non-naturalistic.

  ## Notable Details

  - The eye on the ground hints at perception or vigilance.
  - The castle arch suggests entrapment, contrasting the organic hair.
  - Bold, cartoonish color blocks and smooth forms create a toy-like whimsy.
  - The costume evokes historical or theatrical dress and performative flair.
  - Textures vary: glossy hat, soft hair, plush boot.

  ## Overall Composition

  A tightly composed, near-geometric figure fills the square canvas. Vibrant reds intersect quieter blues and yellows to balance visual weight. The eye moves in a circle: boot to body curve, feathery hat, blue orb, then hand and eye. A tilted head and angled body are stabilized by the left arch, guiding attention across multiple surreal focal points.

  ## Artistic Style

  The piece blends Contemporary Surrealism, Pop Art and Cubism. Exaggerated, overlapping forms mix human features with abstract shapes. Bold outlines, flattened perspectives and playful, graphic rendering nod to Pop Art, while surreal imagery and fragmented elements recall Surrealist tradition in a modern graphic approach.

  ## Technique

  Appears to be oil on canvas, with smooth blending, slight gloss and controlled brushwork. Precise lines define shapes and subtle shading outlines form. Impasto appears minimally on the red feather and highlights, but most surfaces are sleek. Clean edges and solid color blocks emphasize graphic clarity over textured surface.

  ## Color Palette

  Bold, primary colors—bright yellow, deep blue, vivid red, grassy green—dominate, with accents of black, brown and neutrals. High chroma, flat application and strong contrasts give an energetic, playful feel. Stylized shadows and highlights suggest depth without sacrificing flat graphic unity, heightening the surreal intensity.

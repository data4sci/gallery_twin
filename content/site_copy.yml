  # About section
  about_title: "About the Exhibition"
  about_text: |-
    Metamorphoses of Art 2.0 is a collaborative effort by the <a href="https://www.fei.vsb.cz/en/">Faculty of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science at VŠB–Technical University of Ostrava</a>, the <a href="https://www.ekf.vsb.cz/en/">Faculty of Economics at VŠB–TUO</a>, the <a href="https://www.ciirc.cvut.cz/en/">Czech Institute of Informatics, Robotics and Cybernetics at CTU</a>, the <a href="https://www.zushaj.cz/">Vladislav Vančura Elementary Art School in Háj ve Slezsku</a>, and the <a href="https://fu.osu.cz/en/">Faculty of Fine Arts at the University of Ostrava</a>.
  about_text2: "Klára Sedlo’s surreal oil paintings—shaped by imagination, dreams, and subconscious impressions—serve as the control layer for the experiment. Each canvas was described by an AI model, its prose prompt guiding several image generators whose printed “copies” hang beside the originals so visitors can judge composition, gesture, and emotional fidelity."
  about_text3: "The same prompt reached students from partnering art schools, without revealing Klára’s source material, and their responses were scanned and printed at gallery scale. The exhibition now places originals, AI reproductions, and student interpretations in dialogue, revealing how human and artificial neural networks notice different signals—and challenging you to guess which versions were born of silicon or a young hand."

title: "Žonglér"
text_md: |
  A towering, fur-covered figure with multiple hands rises from a golden wheat field, its head a luminous, cloud-like form. Against a dark night sky, a floating yellow orb near its outstretched hands deepens the surreal mystery.

  ## Content

  A surreal anthropomorphic form stands in a wheat field. Its body is dense, sunflower-colored fur with three human arms emerging on the right—one cupped, one relaxed, one with splayed fingers. Its head is a large, white, flower-like structure with soft petals and a central opening, like a dandelion seen from above. To the left floats a bright orange-yellow orb, suggesting sun or moon. The floral head leaves no facial features.

  ## Elements Arrangement

  The figure stands centrally in the foreground, rising from the wheat to reach into the black sky. The middle ground is the golden field, the background a deep, stark sky that highlights the orb and figure. A flat plane of wheat stalks hints at a faint blue horizon below the figure. There are no buildings—only stylized wheat and minimal land. The shallow depth centers attention on the figure and its surroundings.

  ## Notable Details

  Key details are the three realistic hands emerging from the textured fur, contrasting with the fantastical form. The meticulously shaded fur captures light and shadow. The flower-head has soft gradients and blurred edges, amplifying dreamlike ambiguity. The sharp, luminous orange orb echoes the wheat below. The black sky as negative space heightens the figure's surreal isolation. The gently detailed wheat balances the figure's complexity.

  ## Overall Composition

  Vertically oriented, the composition emphasizes the figure's towering, totemic presence against the night sky. Central symmetry aligns all elements on a vertical axis. The viewer's gaze moves from the flower-head, down the textured body and hands, then to the orb and wheat. The contrast between detailed foreground and abstract background adds tension. The orb and flower-head serve as dual focal points, guiding the eye in an arc. The vertical format reinforces the figure's sculptural quality and themes of growth, transformation, and natural cycles.

  ## Artistic Style

  The style is primarily Surrealist, with dreamlike imagery and unexpected juxtapositions—human hands, a flower-head, and a furry form merging with the field. The altered anatomy, floating orb, and poetic ambiguity echo Surrealism's exploration of the unconscious, reminiscent of Yves Tanguy or Leonora Carrington. Subtle hints of Magic Realism appear in the detailed, tangible rendering of fantastical elements.

  ## Technique

  Executed in oil on canvas, the piece features rich blends and smooth gradients, visible in the glowing orb, nuanced flesh tones, and flowing fur textures. Refined, layered brushwork renders tactile textures—fur, skin, wheat—realistically, while the flower and background have soft, diffused edges and a slight sfumato. The smooth surface and controlled transitions suggest glazing or wet-on-wet blending. Detailed organic forms contrast with flatter, nearly abstract color areas.

  ## Color Palette

  The palette features warm earth tones—yellows, golds, ochres—in the wheat and fur, set against a cool, dark backdrop that isolates the figure. The orb adds a luminous warm yellow, its saturation making it a focal point. The hands are naturalistic pinks and creams against the deep sky. Warm yellows and oranges subtly contrast with cooler purples and blues near the horizon. Striking contrasts and harmonious relationships enhance the otherworldly, surreal mood.

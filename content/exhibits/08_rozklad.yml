title: "Rozklad z karet"
text_md: |
  A contemplative figure in a yellow coat sits amid disembodied hands, mouths, and eyes, her expression uneasy introspection. Surreal, overlapping forms radiate from her head, forming a chaotic cascade of fragmented faces and intense gazes that immerse the viewer in psychological overwhelm.

  ## Content

  The artwork centers on a woman in a bright yellow jacket, positioned low and centered. She looks slightly upward and to her left, with closed lips and raised brows conveying pensiveness and concern. Surrounding her head, billowing clusters of fragmented faces, eyes, mouths, and hands in reds and pinks seem to emerge from or envelop her. Many eyes stare in different directions, and mouths gape in alarm. Several hands present simple-symbol cards. The arrangement evokes psychological turmoil, anxiety, and overstimulation as the figure is overwhelmed by the chaotic swarm.

  ## Elements Arrangement

  The composition is layered into foreground, middle ground, and background.

  - Foreground: the sharply rendered central figure, her oversized hands and cards projecting toward the viewer.
  - Middle ground: a thick, swirling pillar of semi-transparent faces and features rising around her.
  - Background: deep blacks and dark reds frame the vivid central forms.

  There's no distinct ground plane or horizon; depth is suggested by overlapping, dreamlike forms. No architectural or natural elements—this is a psychological, surreal setting.

  ## Notable Details

  - Proliferation of eyes and mouths, symbolizing heightened perception or inner voices
  - Hands holding naive-style cards, suggesting fate, choice, or confusion
  - Color contrast from yellow/orange garments to vivid reds and inky blacks
  - Recurring yellow coat buttons linking real and surreal elements
  - Fluid, painterly faces reinforcing motion and unrest
  - A lone forehead eye amid the swirls, hinting at inner vision or altered consciousness

  ## Overall Composition

  A dynamic, vertical structure creates upward movement as features rise like psychic flames. In a vertical rectangle format, the design emphasizes ascent, introspection, and overload. Balance is achieved by symmetrically arranged hands and faces around the central axis. The focal point is the woman's face near the lower center, guiding the eye upward through multiplying forms. Clouds of faces frame and redirect focus to the subject while dissolving into abstraction, conveying intense emotion, inner conflict, and subjective complexity.

  ## Artistic Style

  Surrealist and Psychological Expressionist:

  - Surrealist in the dreamlike, irrational juxtaposition and multiplication of facial features and hands
  - Expressionist in the distorted, fragmented portrayal of psychological struggle
  - Repetition and visual "meltdown" of faces mark a departure from traditional realism

  ## Technique

  Executed in oil on canvas, suggested by rich blending, glazing, and textured brushwork. The central figure is rendered in tight, realistic detail, while surrounding areas dissolve into loose, gestural strokes. Moderate impasto in expressive zones adds a tactile, chaotic surface. Layering and wet-on-wet blending appear in swirling reds, merging controlled portraiture with abstract mark-making for strong textural contrast.

  ## Color Palette

  Dominated by warm, saturated reds and yellows (in the erupting fragments and clothing), contrasted with pale flesh tones and deep blacks for chiaroscuro drama. Cooler blue and violet accents in the cards offer relief. The intentionally discordant, repeated hues and tonal blocks unify the scene while amplifying psychological tension.

title: "Běžící věž"
text_md: |
  A whimsical stone-brick figure strides across a surreal landscape, tongue extended, a blazing heart in its chest, under a sky split by lightning. Floating orbs, stylized foliage, and clouds frame the scene.

  ## Content

  The main subject is a large anthropomorphic figure of connected brick-like segments, like a living golem. It has a human face with rosy cheeks and a wide grin, sticking out a red, forked tongue. Its torso has a heart-shaped cavity containing a vibrant flame. The figure strides dynamically to the right with bent limbs, eyes glancing back to engage the viewer. The background includes a yellow lightning bolt, tall green plants, small round orbs, a stylized tree trunk, a castle-like structure, and blue clouds.

  ## Elements Arrangement

  The stone figure dominates the foreground and middle ground, centered on an undulating green field across the lower image. A torch-like plant and a castle/tower sit at the left. The background is deep black speckled with colored orbs like planets, evoking a cosmic night. A low horizon leaves the sky and clouds above. Architectural and landscape elements flank the figure, while thick blue clouds and a jagged yellow lightning bolt from the upper left dramatize the sky. The space is flattened and fantastical, without traditional perspective.

  ## Notable Details

  - Heart-shaped opening with flame suggests passion or vitality.
  - Brick texture anthropomorphizes architecture.
  - Red, forked tongue adds a playful, mischievous note.
  - Orbs create a surreal, celestial feel.
  - Tree trunk rings in bright yellow and orange echo a cartoon style.
  - Lightning bolt adds dynamic energy.
  - Distant castle implies a mythical context.

  ## Overall Composition

  Horizontally balanced around the central brick figure. Its curving stride creates movement left to right. Left lightning and right stylized tree frame the figure. The flaming heart is an internal focal point. Orbs scattered in the backdrop add rhythm. The vertical format emphasizes the figure's stature and gives room for narrative elements. Bold color contrasts, exaggerated forms, and surreal juxtapositions guide the eye through the work.

  ## Artistic Style

  Surrealism meets Naïve Art. A stone-brick human, exaggerated features (red tongue, bright cheek, flaming heart), and a fantastical setting with lightning, stylized clouds, and an uncanny black sky full of orbs display dream-like illogic. Playful, unrefined forms, flattened depth, and cartoonish motifs reflect Naïve and Pop Surrealism/Lowbrow Art.

  ## Technique

  Oil on canvas with smooth, even brushwork and soft blending for clean edges. The brick pattern has subtle shading for roundness; the face is carefully modeled with highlights. Background elements have controlled gradients without texture or impasto. The matte, uniform surface implies traditional methods with graphic, illustrative forms.

  ## Color Palette

  Vivid, artificial palette of primary and secondary hues: bright yellow (lightning, flame, tree), strong red (tongue, cheek, fire), saturated blue (clouds), lively green (ground, plants). Black sky and neutral brick contrast sharply, making details pop. Warm and cool tones heighten surreal contrasts. High saturation with stylized light and shadow maintains a playful yet uncanny mood.

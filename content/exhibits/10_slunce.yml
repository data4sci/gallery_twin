title: "Slunce"
text_md: |
  A contorted blue figure arches around a radiant yellow orb, hand atop its glowing spikes. This bold, surreal fusion of human form and vivid geometry evokes tension and wonder.

  ## Content

  The artwork shows a stylized human figure bent backward in a near-circular pose. Its left arm arcs from bottom left to center, hand resting on a radiant, spiked yellow orb. The face, at the lower center, looks up with a wide, intense eye and introspective expression. The legs, clad in blue with decorative buttons, extend to the right, feet pointing downward and right. The pink, five-fingered hand on the orb emphasizes its grip. The scene conveys surreal convolution and introspection, suggesting a symbolic link between figure, sun, and pose.

  ## Elements Arrangement

  The yellow sun/orb sits at the intersection of the figure's arms and legs, acting as the visual and conceptual anchor. The figure loops around the orb, enclosing the pictorial space. Foreground elements are limited to the limbs and orb; the flat composition lacks a distinct background. A peach ground offers an uninterrupted backdrop, highlighting the self-contained space formed by the figure's body. Depth is compressed into a contiguous, two-dimensional layout.

  ## Notable Details

  Sharp orange spikes radiate from the orb, intersecting limbs to add tension and movement. The face is framed by exaggerated, swirling hair and a cool-blue eye that contrasts warm yellows. Buttons and patterned cuffs on the pants add whimsical costume details. A subtle, eye-like design at the orb's center reinforces themes of vision and insight. Gentle gradients and painterly transitions enrich the textures of clothing and skin.

  ## Overall Composition

  The tightly coiled figure and central orb form the compositional heart. A spiral of the body and radiating sun lines guide the viewer's gaze around and back to the center. Symmetry balances each side of the figure encircling the orb. The square format amplifies the sense of enclosure and focus, underscoring the introspective, contained nature. The absence of extraneous detail spotlights the surreal interaction between figure and radiant orb, yielding a visually compelling, enigmatic scene.

  ## Artistic Style

  The work aligns with Surrealism, featuring dreamlike distortion of human forms and unexpected juxtapositions. Exaggerated anatomy and the fusion of figure and sun imagery evoke a psychological narrative. Playful, simplified shapes and bold outlines recall modernist illustration and Neo-Expressionism, prioritizing emotion over realism. A contemporary eclecticism blends classic Surrealism with figurative abstraction.

  ## Technique

  Executed in oil or acrylic on canvas, it features smooth, even gradients and soft blending, especially in skin and sun. Brushwork is controlled and tight, lending a polished, graphic quality. Defined, flowing contours articulate the figure and rays, while tonal transitions reflect careful layering. The matte, unified surface shows no mixed media or collage.

  ## Color Palette

  A complementary contrast of cool blues (figure and clothing) and warm yellows and oranges (sun) defines the palette. Cool and warm zones divide clearly, with blues from deep navy to pastel, and highly saturated, luminous yellows and oranges. Moderate tonal range and high contrast emphasize the central sun form. Bold, pure hues create a surreal, theatrical mood.

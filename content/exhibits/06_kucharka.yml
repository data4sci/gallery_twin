text_md: 'A humanoid figure with a white flower head sits against a dark background,
  wearing a gold-buttoned coat over a multicolored striped garment. Red, pointed shapes
  radiate beneath it, and its gently clasped hands hold a green glass bottle at the
  center. Bright hues and surreal forms evoke curiosity.


  ## Content


  The subject is a single, surreal figure at center. Its head is a white blossom with
  a brownish core instead of facial features, giving an unreadable expression. The
  torso is clad in a vibrant striped tunic (red, yellow, blue) with a blue, red-patterned
  collar and a green cloak fastened by large buttons. The red-and-white striped sleeves
  end in blue cuffs. The figure''s hands cradle a round green bottle at midsection.
  Its lower half transforms into a skirt of dense, red, petal- or spike-like shapes
  cascading downward. The pose suggests it is protecting or presenting the bottle.


  ## Elements Arrangement


  The figure dominates the foreground on an uncertain plane merging into deep shadow.
  The near-black background remains formless. A broad blue arc frames the left side
  and top, isolating the figure. A small, flame-like red form hovers in the upper
  left. There is no horizon or architecture, compressing space to focus on the figure.


  ## Notable Details


  Key features include the flower-head, symbolizing anonymity or metamorphosis. The
  costume''s gold buttons, embroidery, and bold colors hint at folklore or celebration.
  The skirt''s sharp, pepper-like spikes suggest both defense and menace. The central
  bottle implies secrets or elixirs. Contrasting textures—smooth petals, glossy spikes,
  rich fabrics—add intrigue. The blue arc and floating red shape imply motion or otherworldliness.


  ## Overall Composition


  Vertically oriented, the composition centers on the seated (or standing) figure,
  forming a pyramidal silhouette. The round flower-head and radial skirt spikes guide
  the eye toward the bottle. Symmetry in posture balances the piece, while color and
  detail variances add dynamism. The blue arc encircles the figure, directing attention
  back to the bottle. The blank background heightens the dreamlike mystery.


  ## Artistic Style


  This work reflects contemporary Surrealism, blending dreamlike imagery and uncanny
  pairings (a flower-headed figure in theatrical attire holding a bottle). Its soft
  modeling and smooth transitions recall Magic Realism and pop-surrealism. Vivid contrasts
  and playful patterns evoke modern illustration and graphic design sensibilities.


  ## Technique


  Likely oil or acrylic on canvas, indicated by deep hues, subtle glazes, and blended
  transitions (notably in the flower-head and shiny spikes). Brushwork is refined,
  with smooth gradients and minimal visible strokes. Contours are crisp where shapes
  meet. The artist contrasts hard, glossy skirt spikes with soft petals and matte
  fabric. Highlights and shadows lend a sculptural quality, while layered paint and
  a modern palette create a contemporary twist.


  ## Color Palette


  The palette is bold and saturated: deep red, forest green, bright blue, golden yellow.
  Primary costume colors contrast with the inky black background, making the figure
  pop. The flower-head''s cool whites and pale grays with a brown center offer calm
  relief. Warm reds in the skirt are offset by cool blue shadows. High contrasts emphasize
  key forms—the bottle, the head, the buttons—adding drama and theatrical flair.

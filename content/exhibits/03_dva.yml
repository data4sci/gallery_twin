title: Dva přátelé, v tomto životě bohužel inkarnovaní do lišky a bažanta
text_md: '## Content


  The central subject is a surreal, multi-headed creature with a wolf-like body on
  human legs. Its faces blend into each other—one snarling, another wide-eyed—with
  smaller heads and eyes embedded in its fur. The right arm stretches toward the lower
  right with splayed fingers; the left arm bends unnaturally. Its gaze darts in multiple
  directions. Below lies a detailed bird resembling a pheasant or partridge on its
  back, wings open, mouth agape in distress, with blood-red markings around the bird
  and the creature''s hand.


  In the upper right sky, an anthropomorphic sun with a smiling face beams dripping
  orange and yellow rays. A stylized star shape hovers nearby. Jagged, radiating forms
  throughout add movement and energy.


  ## Elements Arrangement


  The foreground is dominated by the multi-headed creature and the stricken bird,
  their meeting point—especially the creature''s hand and the bird''s body—acting
  as a dramatic nexus. Textured strokes of green grass and earth fill the ground.


  The middle ground blends horizon and figures, featuring a floating hand, a starburst
  shape, and red finger-like forms. The background sky has angular blue clouds and
  the sun to the right, balancing the creature. Energetic brushwork links foreground
  and background, flattening space.


  ## Notable Details


  - The creature''s body combines animal and human features: multiple heads, disconcerting
  eyes, and human feet.

  - The sun is anthropomorphic, with a mischievous face and dripping rays.

  - Blood-red paint appears as droplets, rays, and markings, intensifying violence
  or energy.

  - The floating hand and yellow starburst look symbolic, hinting at violence, divinity,
  or transformation.

  - Background clouds appear in cubist-like angular forms, heightening the surreal
  mood.

  - The palette is vivid: reds, oranges, and deep browns contrasted with luminous
  blues, adding intensity.


  ## Overall Composition


  The dynamic, asymmetrical composition centers on the creature''s vertical form,
  balanced by its outstretched arm and the sprawled bird. The sun on the right and
  bursting shapes create tension, guiding the eye diagonally. Sharp angles and repeated
  motifs (eyes, masks, rays) unify the scene. The large, near-square vertical format
  and tight framing intensify drama and immediacy.


  ## Artistic Style


  This blend of Surrealism and contemporary figurative painting features dreamlike
  imagery—multi-faced animals, disjointed hands, and a stylized sun—evoking uncanny
  ambiguity. Exaggerated forms, dynamic composition, and energetic visuals hint at
  expressive contemporary trends. Cubist-like inserted eyes and geometric sky fragments
  suggest Neo-Expressionist and Magical Realism influences.


  ## Technique


  Likely oil or acrylic on canvas, indicated by rich blending and visible brushwork.
  Fine, directional strokes detail fur, plumage, and grass, while the sky and sun
  feature smooth gradients and flat shapes. Impasto highlights add texture. Sharp
  edges (claws, rays, feathers) contrast with soft, painterly transitions in clouds
  and shadows.


  ## Color Palette


  Vibrant palette of warm oranges, reds, and yellows, balanced by cooler blues and
  greens. Saturated hues accent the sun, eyes, and bird head, creating focal points.
  Tonal range spans dark browns and blacks to glowing yellows. High contrast between
  warm highlights and muted shadows adds drama. Harmonies (reds with yellows, blues
  with oranges) unify, while discordant greens and repeated eyes heighten the surreal
  mood.
